# Modern C++ Template

A quick C++ template for modern CMake projects, aimed to be an easy to use
starting point.

Forked from: [https://github.com/filipdutescu/modern-cpp-template](https://github.com/filipdutescu/modern-cpp-template)

Removed conan, catch2 and Github workflows to make the template simpler.

Added CMakePresets.json with Debug and Release configure/build/test presets.

Left the Makefile, as it can be modified to work (I don't use it during my regular development, but it can be useful for CI).

Made C++20 the default.
